It hold a vibrant history for me, a steadfast companion through countless childhood dreams. Though not new, it was cherished part of my story.<\/p><p>Frequent moves, however, forced us to part with it, leaving a sur‑prising sense of loss. This taught me that furniture can be more than just objects; they can be \"lifepieces.\"<\/p><p>Later, in college, the hassle of temporary, bulky furniture sparked an idea. Why couldn't furniture be built to last through life's many transitions?<\/p><p>That's why at Allforwood, our mission is \"Design for life.\" We create high‑quality, thoughtfully designed furniture that's also incredibly easy to assemble, disassemble, and transport, ensuring your cherished pieces can move and grow with you through every new
